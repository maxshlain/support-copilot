# Support Copilot: AI-Powered Visual Support Assistant

## The Problem

Every developer and support engineer knows this scenario: you're on a support call, the customer shares their screen showing an issue, and you need help figuring it out. Traditionally, this meant:
- Taking screenshots manually
- Pasting them into chat tools
- Asking colleagues or AI for help
- Repeating the process multiple times

This screenshot-paste-ask-repeat cycle is inefficient and breaks your flow during critical support situations.

## The Solution

Support Copilot streamlines this workflow by:
- **Automatically capturing screenshots** every 5 seconds during support calls
- **Keeping screenshots local** until you choose to share them
- **Integrating with GitHub Copilot** for instant AI assistance
- **Maintaining context** across multiple queries in the same session

## How It Works

1. **Start a support call** - Customer shares their screen
2. **Launch Support Copilot** - Begin automatic screenshot capture
3. **When you need help** - Select a predefined prompt template
4. **Add context** - Include the latest screenshot and additional details
5. **Get AI assistance** - GitHub Copilot analyzes the visual context and provides guidance
6. **Iterate as needed** - Continue the conversation with maintained context

*Note: All screenshots remain on your local machine until you explicitly choose to include them in your AI queries.*
