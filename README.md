# support-copilot

How many times you have been stuck on a technical issue, unable to find a solution online? This project aims to provide a support copilot that can current state and propose a solution.

How it works:
1. You run an app that captures your screen once in 5 seconds.
2. You ask coopilot for a help.
3. Copilot analyzes latests screenshots in screenshots folder and provides a solution.
PROFIT!

Important:
You do not stream your screen, copilot will only analyze screenshots after your request.
Only main screen is captured so if you have multiple monitors, make sure the one with the issue is the main one.
